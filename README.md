# 👋🏾 Hey, I’m Adelodun Abraham

I’m a backend engineer, builder, and community-first problem solver who’s passionate about turning real-world challenges into clean, scalable software — especially in environments where resources are limited but the potential is huge.

I work mostly with **FastAPI**, **Docker**, and **Python**, and I’ve built everything from secure transaction systems to ML pipelines and internal tools. My sweet spot is taking complex requirements and translating them into **modular, production-ready APIs** that just work.

Beyond code, I care deeply about **sustainability, storytelling**, and building tools that **empower people at the edges** — whether through open-source, community-driven projects, or social innovation work like transforming plastic waste or agricultural byproducts into something useful.

If you’re into ethical entrepreneurship, social impact tech, or just want to build tools that matter — we’ll get along.

Let’s build things that scale *and* serve.
